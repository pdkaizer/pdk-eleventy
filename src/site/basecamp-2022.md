Hi Team Basecamp!

## About me and why I’m a designer

I have been a designer of digital products for 22 years, really, I have been a designer and maker of products my whole life, first finely crafted leather goods as a teenager and later hand made pottery. I spent 19 years making and selling [functional stoneware pottery](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/49891508357515603/) to the [American Crafts](https://craftcouncil.org/) Marketplace. The notion of a finely crafted digital product comes from that same attention to detail I had as a studio craftsman crafting objects that are totally usable and part of daily life; the mug you drink your morning coffee out of or the bowl you might eat your lunch out of.

##  Basecamp’s role in my future
I have followed yours and David’s career for a long time and have been a longtime user of Basecamp and a very early adopter go HEY which I love. Basecamp is one of the few companies that I would consider moving to. I am particular interested in your design lead approach to product design and development.


##  My work



## Designers and work I admire

While I did not study traditional graphic design the work of the iconic American graphic designers have had an important influence on my design work. Designers such as [Saul Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass ), [Paul Rand](https://www.paulrand.design), and [Aaron Draplin](https://www.instagram.com/draplin/) for example. Learning digital design in the late nineties, there were numerous early digital designers whose work had a significant impact on my approach to digital product design. [Jeffry Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com ), [Jason Santa Maria](https://jasonsantamaria.com), [Jeff Veen](https://jeffveen.me), [Khoi Vinh](https://www.subtraction.com), and [Andy Clarke](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk) to name a few. More recently I have followed the work [Paul Stamatiou](https://paulstamatiou.com).
